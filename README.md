galojs
======

Galo JS is an attempt to make a js proof assistance.

The project is somehow inspired by other existing proof assistance programs, my favorite is Coq (http://coq.inria.fr/).

My motivation to this project is to learn more about proof concepts but also to make a proof assistance that is closer to a mainstream programing language like JavaScript.

The goals of the project are:

1. Use a pure formal mathematical representation to represent a program, I will call this representation as L,
2. L has to be pure JavaScript language so it can be accessed, manipulated and extended by normal JavaScript code. So all core functionality should be a collection of
JavaScript libs,
3. Completely translate JavaScript language to L,
4. Build mathematical correct libs on top of L that would help on program validation,
5. All L core libs should run on browser and nodejs,
6. Build a interective browser IDE, with offline support, that would be easy to test and exepriment with all the above ideias,

As a test case lambda-calculus had been choosen to be L.

The project is called galojs for the following reasons:

1. JS stands for JavaScript,
2. Galo it's the word translation of Coq, the name of a very good/cool proof assistance program, to Portuguese,
3. Galo it's a Portuguese national symbol ("Galo de Barcelos"),
4. Galo it's Portuguese slang for a bump in your head (witch is how I feel when I think on this stuff),
5. Cock is a animal that is always trying to proof himself,
6. Cocks are like penguins they are birds that can't fly, except they can fly a little...
